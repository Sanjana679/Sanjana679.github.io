Hi, I'm Sanjana Nandi — a software engineer that likes building things that solve real-world problems. My work bridges research and practical application, driven by a fascination with how abstract ideas translate into tools that shape people’s lives.

I specialize in machine learning and computational imaging, though I am fascinated by distributed systems. I've worked on projects from topics ranging from multi-agent task completion to natural language processing. I’m always seeking opportunities to collaborate on meaningful, high-impact work.

Outside of work, you might find me reading or crocheting.

If you’re interested in working together, chatting about research, or just swapping ideas over coffee (virtual or real), feel free to contact me at the socials below.
