In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we‚Äôre introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that‚Äôs lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We‚Äôre also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5‚Äôs 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It‚Äôs optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it‚Äôs a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it‚Äôs highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it‚Äôs been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called ‚Äúdistillation,‚Äù where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash‚Äôs availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we‚Äôve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we‚Äôve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We‚Äôve improved control over the model‚Äôs responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we‚Äôve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we‚Äôre now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do ‚Äî not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we‚Äôre also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We‚Äôre announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we‚Äôve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind‚Äôs mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we‚Äôve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That‚Äôs why today, we‚Äôre sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do ‚Äî and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we‚Äôve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we‚Äôve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we‚Äôve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they‚Äôre being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it‚Äôs easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We‚Äôve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we‚Äôre always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we‚Äôre able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

With the rapid increase in the use of Zoom and other forms of digital communication, the effect of communication technology on human relationships has been questioned.</p> <p>My two cents about this issue - communication technology isn‚Äôt inherently good or bad. It is a tool that opens the door to more human connection. This time, I will take a literary approach to proving my claim, referencing two early sci-fi books and some peer-reviewed articles. The deficiencies associated with communication technology are already well-spoken. It is common knowledge that digital communication doesn‚Äôt come close to capturing the intricacies associated with human interactions. As McCormack states in his paper Dispatches from the Cage: Henry James and Information Technology, digital messages ‚Ä¶[have] lost‚Ä¶[their] connection with both its speaker and its audience and, dispatched, floats somewhere in an interpretative void (93).</p> <p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/30002408">Link - Dispatches from the Cage: Henry James and Information Technology by Jerusha McCormack</a></p> <p>Many issues we face with communication technology were predicted well in the past - almost as long ago as the late 1800s - by authors such as E.M. Forster. In her paper, Zimmermann states, [s]uch communication mediated by machines, fear of human contact, emotional engagement, bodily weakness, frontiers of time and space blurred by virtual interactions are elements in Forsters‚Äô novel that also figure in our current scientific debates (39).</p> <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313868867_E_M_Forster%27s_%27The_Machine_Stops%27_humans_technology_and_dialogue">Link - E.M. Forsters The Machine Stops: humans, technology, and dialogue by A.C. Zimmermann</a></p> <p>The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster tells the story of Vashti and Kuno in a world where most of the human population lives underground under the protection of the omnipotent Machine. All their desires and needs are taken care of by the Machine. People spend their lives in their rooms, communicating through video screens. Humans no longer use technology to seek what they desire, as the Machine brings everything to them. Content with their sedentary life, humans developed an aversion to the surface and direct experiences not monitored by the Machine. The only exception is Kuno, who escapes, experiencing a brief moment on the surface before being dragged back down by the Machine.</p> <p>Kuno tries to warn his mother, Vashti, of the impending destruction of the Machine, but she is only confused. Slowly, the Machine stops operating. Gradually, the Machine can no longer sustain human life. At this moment, humanity suddenly has its first real experience - its destruction. From the story‚Äôs events, we can see that Forster intended to warn of technology‚Äôs dangers and advocate direct experience.</p> <p>However, somewhat contradictory to Forsters‚Äô claims, face-to-face interaction between the protagonist of In the Cage and Captain Everard is where their relationship breaks apart. In the Cage by Henry James describes an unnamed London telegraphist who deciphers clues to her clients‚Äô personal lives from their telegrams from her cage at the post office. Eventually, she becomes interested in and deceived by two lovers - Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen.</p> <p>The telegraph is what provides the protagonist with entertainment in her mundane life. The protagonist initially draws pleasure from the various pieces of information from Captain Everard‚Äôs messages without intending to pursue a further relationship. As Cormack states to the protagonist, ‚Äú[t]he cage of class remains absolute, after all - but only outside the network established by the telegraph office. Within that cage, she portends the power of the new democracy of the electronic age, in which all are levelled by the open intimacy of this revolutionary mode of communication‚Äù (91).</p> <p>But upon learning of Captain Everard‚Äôs wealth, she pursues him, indulging in the fantasy that she could marry him and elevate her societal status. Throughout the story, the telegraph serves to give the protagonist pieces of information about the situation between Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen. Still, it never forces her into an interpretation of the information she gets. In contrast, her face-to-face meetings with Captain Everard push the protagonist towards her incorrect assumptions about the relationship between Captain Everard and herself. Throughout the story, the protagonist remains oblivious to Captain Everard‚Äôs true intentions in talking with her and his background. The deception is only revealed after the protagonist‚Äôs conversation with Mrs. Jordan about Captain Everard‚Äôs union with Lady Bradeen and his debt. The protagonist doesn‚Äôt realize the true nature of the situation in which she has tangled herself. Whether through interacting with them through their telegrams or speaking to both Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen in person, the protagonist fails to form any kind of substantial relationship with either Captain Everard or Lady Bradeen.</p> <p>In contrast, Vashti and Kuno in The Machine Stops have a better understanding of one another despite not speaking face to face often or even speaking often - even despite Vashti acknowledging that ‚Äúthe Machine did not transmit nuances of expression. It only gave a general idea of people ‚Äî an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes‚Ä¶‚Äù(89). Whatever the Machine can convey in its limited capacity is enough for Vashti to grasp the meaning behind her son‚Äôs words throughout their conversations at various points in the book. When the Machine stops and humankind is dying, Vashti reconciles with her son, both of them crying and hoping that humanity won‚Äôt be foolish enough to start the Machine again in the future. Both Vashti and Kuno may not have spoken much throughout their lives (and mostly spoke through the Machine), but they understand one another. They held different views from one another, but they could communicate their thoughts clearly, even over an indirect form of communication. Vashti and Kuno have a much more transparent and open relationship than Captain Everard and the protagonist from In the Cage despite the indirectness of their relationship compared to Captain Everard and the protagonist‚Äôs relationship.</p> <p>As evident from the events in The Machine Stops and In the Cage, relationships and human connection takes work. It is far from reaching out to a new person and expecting to get along perfectly. It takes a mutual understanding from both parties and a willingness to make it work. As Zimmermann states, an emotional connection is challenging; it needs work, engagement, care about the Other, and nourishment. Developing friendship or a marriage for instance living the encounter with all the complexity and expressivity that it requires (43).</p> <p>By itself, communication technology doesn‚Äôt have the inherent ability to affect the relationships between humans. However, communication technology gives us the opportunity for more human interaction. It is up to humans to utilize that resource for what it is. This fact is displayed both in The Machine Stops and In the Cage. In In the Cage, the direct face-to-face communication between Captain Everard and the protagonist doesn‚Äôt make their relationship any better. The protagonist is still oblivious to the actual reason for Captain Everard‚Äôs interactions.</p> <p>In contrast, in The Machine Stops, Vashti and Kuno don‚Äôt directly communicate for much of their lives. However, despite mainly communicating through the Machine, they truly understand one another and have a genuine mother-son relationship even as their world collapses around them. In the end, communication technology is a tool for humankind. And like all tools, it is up to the wielder to correctly utilize it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="school"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[this is what included image galleries could look like]]></summary></entry></feed>
